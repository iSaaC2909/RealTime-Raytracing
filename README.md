Implementation Details
Rendering Pipeline

Ray Generation:

The camera system generates primary rays based on the view frustum
Each ray corresponds to a pixel in the output image
Ray direction is calculated using a perspective projection matrix derived from the camera's position, orientation, and field of view


Parallel Ray Processing:

CUDA kernel launches with a thread for each pixel/ray
Threads are organized in a 2D grid matching the output resolution
Each thread processes its corresponding ray independently


Intersection Testing:

Each ray is tested against all objects in the scene (currently spheres)
Sphere intersection uses the quadratic formula to solve for ray-sphere intersections
The closest intersection point is recorded along with normal information


Shading Calculation:

Basic Lambertian diffuse shading is applied
Lighting direction and intensity determine surface brightness
Potential for more complex materials and lighting models


Frame Buffer Update:

Final colors are written to the frame buffer in parallel
CUDA manages the memory transfer from device to host when rendering completes


OpenGL Display:

The frame buffer is mapped to an OpenGL texture
A simple quad is rendered with this texture
GLFW handles window refresh and vsync



Technical Implementation
Vector Math
The ray tracer includes two parallel vector math implementations:

CUDA Vector Math (cuda::Vector3):

Optimized for GPU execution with __device__ and __host__ attributes
Includes basic vector operations (+, -, *, /) and utilities
Used on the GPU side for intersection calculations
Conditionally compiled with RT_DLL macro for shared code usage


GLM Integration:

Uses the GLM library for CPU-side vector operations
Provides seamless integration with OpenGL's matrix system
Used for camera transformations and view matrix calculations



Camera System
The camera implementation provides an interactive first-person perspective:

View Matrix Calculation:

Forward, right, and up vectors form the camera's local coordinate frame
Look-at matrix provides the world-to-view transformation
Support for pitch and yaw rotation with sensible constraints


Ray Direction Calculation:

Maps screen coordinates to NDC (Normalized Device Coordinates)
Applies inverse projection to generate ray directions
Accounts for field of view and aspect ratio


Movement System:

WASD keys provide forward/backward/strafe movement
Mouse input controls camera orientation
Smooth movement with delta time scaling



Intersection Testing
Ray-sphere intersection is implemented using the analytical solution:

Ray-Sphere Testing:

Calculates closest point between ray and sphere center
Compares distance to sphere radius
Solves for intersection points using Pythagorean theorem
Accounts for rays originating inside objects


Performance Optimizations:

Early rejection of rays that can't possibly hit the sphere
Minimal square root operations to improve performance
Parallel execution across all pixels



CUDA Integration
The ray tracer uses CUDA for parallel rendering:

Kernel Design:

The main rendering kernel maps one thread to one pixel
Thread blocks are organized into a 2D grid matching the output resolution
Memory coalescing techniques to maximize memory bandwidth


Memory Management:

The frame buffer is allocated as pinned memory for efficient transfers
Scene data is kept in constant memory for fast access
Thread-local registers store interim calculation results


CPU-GPU Communication:

Minimal data transfers between renders to maximize performance
Camera and object parameters are updated on the GPU as needed
Frame buffer is transferred once per frame



OpenGL Display
The rendered image is displayed using OpenGL:

Texture Mapping:

The frame buffer is mapped to a 2D texture
A screen-aligned quad displays the texture
Texture updates happen each frame with the new render


Shader Pipeline:

Simple vertex and fragment shaders display the texture
Potential for post-processing effects in the fragment shader
Custom shader manager handles shader loading and compilation



Performance Considerations
The ray tracer prioritizes performance through several optimizations:

Parallel Execution:

CUDA kernels exploit massive GPU parallelism
Each pixel is processed independently for perfect parallelization
Thread blocks are sized to maximize SM utilization on NVIDIA GPUs


Memory Access Patterns:

Coalesced memory access for frame buffer operations
Constant memory for scene data and camera parameters
Shared memory for object data when processing multiple objects


Computation Optimizations:

Fast math instructions for non-critical calculations
Early ray termination for rays that miss all objects
Minimal branches to avoid thread divergence
Vector operations optimized for GPU execution


Asynchronous Processing:

Frame rendering and display operate asynchronously
CUDA stream management for overlapping computation and data transfer
Input processing happens concurrently with rendering


Profiling and Bottleneck Identification:

Performance monitoring using CUDA events
Frame timing is tracked to identify performance bottlenecks
Commented-out timing code ready for detailed profiling



Current Limitations and Challenges

Geometric Primitives:

Currently limited to sphere primitives
Adding triangles would allow for arbitrary mesh rendering
Acceleration structures needed for complex scenes


Lighting Model:

Simple diffuse shading currently implemented
No shadows, reflections, or global illumination effects

Vector Math Bugs:

The -= operator in the Vector3 class incorrectly uses addition

Camera Model:

Current pinhole camera model is simple but limited
No depth of field or motion blur effects
Camera matrix calculation could be further optimized


Memory Management:

More sophisticated memory allocation needed for dynamic scenes
Current fixed-size frame buffer limits flexibility
No denoising or temporal accumulation for image quality
